## Highlights

\begin{highlights}
\item The design of a novel, modular lactate biosensor has been proposed for use in point-of-care clinical settings.

\item The new biosensor design separates the hydrogel enzyme layer from the reusable electrode base.

\item Lactate oxidase, whose activity underpins the biosensor, acts via the ping-pong mechanism, and a reaction-diffusion model is subsequently used to simulate the operation of the biosensor. 

\item The enzyme kinetics simplifies to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with uncompetitive inhibition. Numerical simulations quantify how kinetic and transport parameters affect sensor performance.

\item The model-guided design framework enables rapid, cost-effective optimization without trial-and-error.
