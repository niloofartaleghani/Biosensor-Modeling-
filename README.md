Numerical modeling of amperometric biosensors for detecting L-Lactate with uncompetitive inhibition by using Explicit Finite Difference

## Highlights

- Implements the ping-pong Bi-Bi enzymatic kinetics for lactate oxidase (LOx)
- Simplifies the model under **oxygen-rich conditions**, treating Oâ‚‚ as saturating
- Models **ascorbic acid (vitamin C)** as an **uncompetitive inhibitor**, relevant for sepsis patients
- Solves the substrate-product-inhibitor PDE system using **explicit second-order finite difference**
- Visualizes substrate/inhibitor profiles and biosensor current response
- Enables parameter sweeps for sensor optimization
